# Me vs My Bro
In this I manage to build a CNN Neural Network which has the potential to classify between me (Manoj) and my brother (Neeraj).

### Data Collection
I used the Keras image agumentation function from the keras preprocessing module to generate many images from the base image, I have used like 10 base images to generate the training and test dataset of both me and my brother each.

> Due to privacy issues I'm not uploading the dataset.

Though the Model manages to give us 96% Training Accuracy and 89% Validation Accuracy, we cannot take this for granted, as I have supplied only few hundreds of images in the dataset the CNN cannot be able to capture many of the features.
